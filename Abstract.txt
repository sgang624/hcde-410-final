This study aims to explore the relationship between the amount of crime faced in a given neighborhood and the overall level 
of income of its residents (measured by that neighborhood's Housing Price Index). It is evident from the results that neighborhoods
of lower HPI values tend to face greater levels of crime, primarily in the forms of assaults and robberies, than do neighborhoods of 
medium and higher HPI values.
