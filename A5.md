# A5: Final Project Plan
# Project Proposal
# by Suraj Gangaram



## **Motivation and Problem Statement**
The project I am proposing aims to bring light to the **lack of safety** in lower-income neighborhoods. Through analyzing different neighborhoods' **crime and safety data** with respect to the **socioeconomic standings** of their respective families, I hope to raise attention to the discrepancies between the amount of police and crime protection low income neighborhoods receive in comparison to higher income neighborhoods (income level determined by Federal Housing Finance Agency: House Price Index (**HPI**)). With the results gathered from this project, I hope to provide useful insight for those representing lower income neighborhoods and incentive to bring about change, through implementing **new legislation and bills** to ensure that those with low incomes feel safe and are protected from crimes within their neighborhoods. Additionally, I hope that this project will spark interest in others to also research the differences in crime and protection and continue to provide more data to implement changes to address these inequities, which makes it very beneficial through both a practical and human-centered perspective.

## **Overview and Research Questions**
The research questions I plan to address with this project are motivated by procuring the basic safety needs for those living within the neighborhoods of interest. I am cognizant of the variances in police protection within higher income communities in contrast to lower income communities. Shedding light on and addressing these questions are vital to bringing about change. These research questions are important because they will challenge the current policing and crime protection of lower income communities and provide the necessary basis to explore the data regarding crime rates. With the data collected, I plan to help find answers to the questions below:

1. How much of an issue is neighborhood safety in low income areas?
2. What type of crimes are likely to occur in low-income areas?
3. What is the difference between crime rates in low-income and high-income areas?
4. What crime is most prevalent in low-income and high-income areas in recent years (1990-2015)?

## Background and/or Related Work 
There are related to **house price indices** and **types of crime occurring** in various areas throughout the United States. However, there are not any datasets that I have seen which involve the comparison between the two variables of interest.

The [Housing-Index dataset](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx) is verified by the **United States Federal Housing Finance Agency** or FHFA. The dataset is collected by reviewing mortgage transactions on single family properties since January 1975. Each transaction is either purchased or secured by mortgage loan companies Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. This dataset was last updated on November 29, 2020. Considering this dataset was reviewed by a government agency and two mortgage loan companies further secured it, I believe this dataset is very trustworthy and credible.

The [Crime In Context dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshallproject/crime-rates) was created by Gabriel Dance, Tom Meagher, and Emily Hopkin of the Marshall Project. They compiled this dataset from **the four major crimes data** the FBI classifies as violent. This includes homicide, rape, robbery and assault. This dataset includes 68 police jurisdictions with populations over 250,000 or greater. Only 1975 - 2014 data came directly from the FBI. This part of the data came from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program's "Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest" database. The 2015 data was obtained from directly contacting the police agency. Only 61 police jurisdictions data was collected for 2015. The analysis for the crime rate calculated is based on a per 100,000 residents in a police jurisdiction. The 2015 crime rate analysis is based on 2014 population estimate. Considering most of this dataset came from the FBI and parts of it also came directly from police institutions, I believe that the source of the data is very secure and trustworthy. As for the analysis, the depth in which the Marshall project reveals their methodology and also directly naming the people working on the analysis make the analysis quite credible and trustworthy.

Through having learned about such background information within these datasets, I am motivated to combine the two variables in each respective dataset to go about comparing how socioeconomic standing, measured by house price indices, is related to crime rates in a given area. Each of my research questions answers something about each facet within the two datasets, **crime** and **income level**, as I aim to draw a conclusion about the association between the two through this project.

## **Data Selected for Analysis**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandeep04201988/housing-price-index-using-crime-rate-data?select=merged_dataset.csv) I will use compares housing price index with crime rates in various cities around the United States from 1975 to 2015. It has 3477 rows/observations and 9 columns/features. 

The data represents communities from around the United States over the span of 40 years. Some of the crimes, or variables, that were recorded in this dataset are homicides, rapes, assaults and robberies. The city, population, year and housing price index are also included. The data was collected from another Kaggle dataset, created by the **Marshall Project**, that measures crime rates across the United States from 1975 to 2015 and the FHFA house prices index. The Marshall Project, created in 2014, is a nonprofit, online journalism organization with a focus on issues related to criminal justice in the United States. It has been funded by donations and grants from various individuals and foundations. The FHFA is a federal agency in the United States that regulates mortgages. The house prices index is a measure of the movement of single-family house prices. This data is created from the merging of the Housing-Index dataset and Crime in Context dataset. The merged dataset is questionable in its validation and security, but The dataset that should be composed of this merged dataset is very credible and secure. I am considering merging the two sourced dataset ourselves to ensure the validity, security, and credibility of the data I am working with.

I obtained the housing price index and crime rate dataset from Kaggle. It was created by merging the two datasets from The Marshall Project and FHFA, listed above. They were merged together by Kaggle contributor, SandeepRamesh, with the goal of uncovering a correlation between **crime rate** and **housing price index**.

## **Unknowns and Dependencies**
After cleaning the dataset up, I found that there are only 1714 rows/observations useful to work with. I believe this is due to programming errors in previous mergers of the dataset before I got this data. However, this was likely an formatting error rather than significant data loss, so I am still planning on using it.

As for being able to get this project done in a timely manner, I need to work with the professor and TA heavily to ensure that I am not going too far into a rabbit hole with this project. I have been sick the past week and really busy leading up to now this quarter, and I need to make sure I am not falling behind or not missing anything. I do have a lot of other responsibilities with my other classes and extracurriculars, so I want to make sure I can be on top of this project by reaching out and consistently communicating with the 410 staff.

## **Methodology**
To properly frame my analysis and be able to gather valuable and actionable insights on the crime dataset of interest, I plan on using the programming language **R**. It offers a multitude of libraries to go about reading, parsing through, filtering and cleaning datasets. Using the **dplyr** library and its many functions such as **group()** and **filter()**, I can group various data tables and calculate aggregate values in order to go about generating important data for me to eventually analyze. I will go about using the I plan to answer my respective research questions through the methods below:

1. I plan to address the first research question by selecting the lower income communities and observing the amount of violent crimes that occur within them. 
2. Using the different types of crimes listed in the dataset, I would be able to answer the second research question by determining which crimes are most likely to occur in low income areas through comparing the proportion of the total violent crimes each one of them makes up in certain communities. 
3. I can answer the third research question by grouping the housing price index into different income levels and comparing the differences in crime rates between them. 
4. For the fourth question, I can answer it by grouping the dataset into high and low-income areas, and then further group them based on years. I can then compare the averages of different crime rates based on year and split the data into two graphs for high and low income areas to analyze the trend in crime rate.

From there, I can implement the in-built **Plotly** library and use the **ggplot()** function to go about visualizing and plotting my analyses. I will be able to present my filtered data using various bar charts, scatterplots and box & whisker plots, depending on what I feel is best suited for each type of research question.

Using functions to filter through the dataset will enable me to highlight important data that I can go about graphing and plotting, serving as visual representations for an audience interested in learning more about the topic and potentially wanting to take action. Using these methods, I will be able to present my findings in a manner that is impactful and actionable, bringing light to the underlying issues faced by neighborhoods that often go unspoken or are even purposefully hidden to the public.
